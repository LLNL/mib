			       MIB
		    MPI (POSIX) I/O BENCHMARK
			Andrew C. Uselton
		     Updated October 1, 2005

Since the original "MIB" was written IOR has itself gone through a
rewrite, and is now up to version 2.8.7.  In the intervening time I
have become more familiar with the problem of benchmarking a parallel
file system and the compromises made in IOR version 2.  In order to
address those issues I've decided to update MIB in the same spirit as
its original.  As before, MIB is intended to do one thing and do it
well.  The goal of MIB is to be a precise tool for the diagnosis of
I/O performace problems.  As such, it is expected that minor changes
will be introduced from time to time.  The changes are not intended as
improvements, per se, but as refinements of the target of the current
inquiry.  Thus keeping the base code clean and clear is a priority.  

MIB will continue to have the following properties:
o MPI-based
o POSIX system calls only
o One file per MPI task only
o The test runs exactly once with the given parameters
New factors govorning its construction include:
o Performace measures via stonewalling (i.e. time-limited) as well as
  space limited tests
o All system calls are wrapped and built on the error handling module.
o A spec file allows for RPMs to be built.
