			       MIB
		    MPI (POSIX) I/O BENCHMARK
			Andrew C. Uselton
		     Updated April 5, 2006

Mib is an outgrowth of Lustre (http://www.lustre.org/) benchmarking
efforts at LLNL, though its operation does not require Lustre.  It
resembles the IOR benchmark (ftp://ftp.llnl.gov/pub/siop/ior/) in that
it carries out I/O to a parallel file system from within a coordinated
parallel MPI application.  

  Mib is an MPI I/O test that has each MPI task perform I/O of a
fixed size per system call.  The tasks first write to and then read
from files named in a conventional way.  Mib assumes that the files
are on a parallel file system. The file a task reads from is
distinct from the file written to, if possible.  This defeats
caching at the clients.  Optionally, detailed timing data for
the system calls is sent to a file (one for writes and one for
reads) after the I/O is complete.
 
  Mib is intended to be as simple as possible (but no simpler).
The results are easy to interpret. The code is easy to extend.

  Mib has all the tasks stop after the same amount of time.  This
is "stonewalling" mode.  It will also stop after all tasks complete
a fixed number of system calls.  This is non-stonewalling mode.
Whichever citerion is satisfied first within a task ends I/O from
that task.  It is possible for system call limits and time limits
to be chosen so that some tasks finish due to one limit and other
tasks due to the other limit.  I don't see how that could be
desirable, but is allowed and no special note is made if it does
happen.  In order to be sure one is in stonewalling mode or
non-stornewalling mode one needs to have a good idea about the
relative progress of the fastest and slowest tasks in a test.  For
stonewalling one sets the limit on system calls above what even the
fastest task would achieve given the time limit.  Conversely, for
non-stonewalling mode set the limit on system calls below what even
the slowest would achieve in the time limit.  Note that stonewalling
mode will give the best estimate for maximum sustained throughput,
while non-stonewalling mode will more closely reflect actual "user"
experience (users of the file system not users of mib).   

Mib has two advantages over IOR.  First, it is very simple.  Following
the idea of "do only one thing, and do it well," mib avoids the
complexity and size associated with IOR.  It loads quickly.  It is
easily modified to suit specific local needs.  Second, it will
optionally produce a "profile" of the timing of every system call.
These timings are synchronized and coordinated accross all tasks.
Post-processing tools (see the "mib-tools" RPM) can manipulate
the profiles to give a graphical view of the dynamic behavior of the
file system under the load provided by mib.  These graphs have proven
valuable in isolating performance bottlenecks in Lustre.  Mib is not
intended to replace IOR but rather to compliment it.  IOR operates in
mnay more modes and with much wider applicability than mib.

Mib is characterized by the following:
o Both MPI and non-MPI operation
o POSIX system calls only
o One file per MPI task
o The test runs exactly once with the given parameters

$mib -V
mib-1.9.6-i386
$mib -h
usage: mib [b::EFIhHl:L:Mnp:PrRs:St:VW]
See the man page for "long_opts" equivalents.
    -b [<gran>]     :  Random seeks (optional granularity) before each read.
    -E              :  Show environment of test in output.
    -F              :  Mib does not normally allow I/O to any FS
                    :  but Lustre.  This overrides the "safety".
    -I              :  Show intermediate values in output.
    -h              :  Print this message and exit.
    -H              :  Show headers in output.
    -l <call_limit> :  Issue no more than this many system calls.
    -L <time_limit> :  Do not issue new system calls after this many
                    :    seconds (limits are per phase for write and
                    :    read phases).
    -M              :  Do not use MPI even if it is available.
    -n              :  Create new files if files were already present
                    :    (will always create new files if none were
                    :    present).
    -p <profiles>   :  Output system call timing profiles to 
                    :    <profiles>.write and <profiles>.read.
    -P              :  Show progress bars during testing.
    -r              :  Remove files when done.
    -R              :  Only perform the read test.
    -s <call_size>  :  Use system calls of this size (default 512k).
                    :    Numbers may use abreviations k, K, m, or M.
    -S              :  Show signon message, including date, program
                    :    name, and version.
    -t <test_dir>   :  Required. I/O transactions to and from this
                    :    directory.
    -V              :  Print the version and exit.
    -W              :  Only perform the write test
                    :    (if -R and -W are both present both tests 
                    :     will run, but that's the default anyway).

In the LLNL Linux clusters environment the SLURM
(http://www.llnl.gov/linux/slurm/) command "srun" launches MPI
applications.  A typical invokation might be 

srun -N8 -p ltest mib -t /p/ga2/lustre-test/mib/newfiles
 |    |      |     |       |
 |    |      |     |       ---target directory
 |    |      |     -----------MPI application
 |    |      -----------------partition (group of target nodes)
 |    ------------------------number of tasks
 -----------------------------SLURM MPI launcher

This example would run 8 MPI tasks on nodes taken from the "ltest"
group of compute nodes and the mib executable would open, write to,
close, open, read from, and close, a unique file for each task all in
the given directory.  The I/O would continue for the default amount of
time or the default number of transfers (whichever comes frst), and
would involve system calls using the default amount of data.  In the
following discussion assume the following shell variables are defined
to create the above command line: 

SCOM="srun -N8 -p ltest"
MCOM="mib -t /p/ga2/lustre-test/mib/newfiles"

The most common use would include a limit on the number of system
calls, a limit on time, and a system call size.  For instance if we
wanted to perform per taks no more than 4096 system calls of 512k
bytes each and to cease issuing system calls after 60 seconds, the
command would look like this:

$SCOM $MCOM -l 1024 -L 60 -s 512k

A typical result for the above command (as observed on the ALC
cluster) would look like this:


Fri Mar 17 22:50:59 2006      8    4M  4500   300	897.07     566.20

The "-H" option provides an informative header:

$SCOM $MCOM -l 1024 -L 60 -s 512k -H

           date            tasks  xfer  call  time      write       read
                                       limit limit       MB/s       MB/s
 ------------------------ ------ ----- ----- ----- ---------- ----------
 Fri Mar 17 22:50:59 2006      8    4M  4500   300     897.07      566.20

The next most common use for mib is to generate a system casll timing
profile.  The command:

$SCOM $MCOM -l 1024 -L 60 -s 512k -p ~/alc/profile

creates two files, "~/alc/profile.write" and "~/alc/profile.read".
Each of those is a table with one line per system call, and on each
line, one floating point number per task.  Each number is the
timestamp of the corresponding system call (i.e. the MPI_Wtime() at
which it returned) on the corresponding task.  The timestamps are all
relative to a "zero" at the beginning of the test coordinated accross
all tasks and adjusted for any skew in the "MPI_Wtime()" global clock
reading.
