emm, the idea of dll's sound good, but i find it causes no end to pain
and misery for most people. Its probably bad practice but i prefer to
get the users on our compute systems to statically compile things as
much as possible and stow it away (especially with computational
libraries etc...) the less fiddling the user has to do the less they can
mess up :)

since its a test on/for distributed/parallel filesystems i'd be quite
happy if the non-mpi version was dropped and if the mpi version kept. a
user can always do "mpirun -np 1 mib -t ...." i'd expect most people who
want use mib will have mpi installed. i prefer to have simple tools :P

regarding mib, it seems okay as it is right now, it does what you would
want and expect. I certainly found it an interesting and useful tool to
see how our gpfs and ddn setup behaves (i need to spend some more time
to really look at it). 

also after poking at the configure script and makefile, i had half
considered in writing a cmake file for it to make life easier for
myself. I can see myself using this program a few more times as we
upgrade our kit. so you may see a cmake file from me in a few
weeks/months.

I saw that, i wasn't too sure if i should have filed a bug report there or
not, im not a huge fan of sourceforge so i just decided to email the
author of the program.



Thanks,
Jimmy.
