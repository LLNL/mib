	* : tag 1.9.10

	* src/sys_wrap.c : Call perror before calling FAIL on syscall error.

	* src/miberr.h : Change ASSERT/FAIL messages to use file::line fmt.
	Have ASSERT print the condition that failed.

	* src/mib.c : Use stderr for error messages, not stdout.

	* src/sys_wrap.c : Add IOMalloc() function to return page-aligned
	buffers suitable for O_DIRECT I/O.

	* src/mib.c : Allocate I/O buffers using IOMalloc(), and open with
	O_DIRECT if -d (--directio) option was used.

	* src/options.[ch], doc/mib.1 : Add -d (--directio) option.

2008-09-27 Jim Garlick <garlick@llnl.gov>

	* : tag 1.9.9

	* slurm.[ch] : Removed.

	* src/mpi_wrap.c, src/mib.c : Drop suport for -M (no mpi) option.

2008-01-31 Jim Garlick <garlick@llnl.gov>

	* : tag 1.9.8-8

	* mib.spec : Add mvapich-shmem to BuildRequires.

2007-09-30 Jim Garlick <garlick@llnl.gov>

	* : tag 1.9.8-7chaos

	* src/slurm.[ch] : Comment out all unused slurm info from struct
	to make it clear what is being used from slurm.

	* src/config.h : Remove.

	* src/mpi_wrap.c : Explicitly call MPI functions, not via dlopen.

	* src/Makefile : Compile with mib mpicc.

	* src/Makefile : Compile mib-serial with gcc and no MPI.

2007-05-05 Jim Garlick <garlick@llnl.gov>

	* : tag 1.9.8-5chaos

	* Makefile : Removed bogus quilt target.  Call mkinstalldirs 
	with -m 755 to avoid wrong permissions on /usr/lustre.

	* scripts/quilt.sh : Removed, no quilt here.

	* mib.spec : Change deprecated Copyright to License.
	Drop version information that will be overwritten by build buddah.
	Add runes to skip debug package and not strip executables.

2006-10-30 Andrew Uselton <uselton2@llnl.gov>

	* : Removed the sum.pl script which is also in the auto-test
	package.  
	
2006-10-27 Andrew Uselton <uselton2@llnl.gov>

	* : Added a discussion of library handling in the README.
	
2006-10-04 Andrew Uselton <uselton2@llnl.gov>

	* : Put default ownership of (root, root) on the files in the spec
	file for the tools package.  
	
2006-08-07 Andrew Uselton <uselton2@llnl.gov>

	* : Tag 1.9.7

	* : Modify RPM spec file to always create the
	/var/lustredata/scripts directory.  N.B.  I'd avoided this before
	because the existance of that directory might induce someone ot
	run tests and send the results there.  That could fill the root
	partition quickly if there isn't a separate /var/lustredata
	storage allocation (NFS mount).  This makes CHAOS not install
	cleanly on clusters with no Lustre.  So ite bullet and maybe
	rethink in the future.

	* : Fixed (harmless) storage leak used for communicating timing
	results in an MPI_Gather.

2006-07-13 Andrew Uselton <uselton2@llnl.gov>

	* : Tag 1.9.6

	* : Update all files with UCRL number in preparation for release.

	* : Sanity check documentation.
	
	* : Caught and fixed a bug in options handling.  Send the correct
	argc and argv to MPI_Init if you plan on consuming command line
	parameters and options.  It would segfault trying to get to
	argv[0] when sent argc = 0, which is wrong in a couple of ways. 
	
2006-06-29 Andrew Uselton <uselton2@llnl.gov>

	* : Tag 1.9.5

	* : Modify dlopen() code to be configurable, set up elan and
	infiniband  variants.

	* : Cast the "size_t count" parameter to Write() and Read() to be
	ssize_t.  This prevents incorrect execution when the
	system call returns an error condition (-1) and misinterprets it
	as a very large number.  There is also one in Snprintf.

	* : Include "-Wextra" as a CCFLAGS flag to catch future instances of
	the above.  
	
2006-04-26 Andrew Uselton <uselton2@llnl.gov>

	* : Tag 1.9.4

	* : Add lwatch.py to the project, since lmtd actually is available
	as open source.  Modify references saying otherwise in the 
	documentations.
	
2006-04-20 Andrew Uselton <uselton2@llnl.gov>

	* : Tag 1.9.3

	* : Fix really stupid, pernicious, and fundamental bug regarding use
	of opt->flags and verbosity references in macros.  They appear in
	several places, especially base_report, before opts is
	initialized.  1) split base_report from flags test and introduce
	new conditional_report.  2) do not refer to opts in macros defined
	in options.h.  Use opts in macros only locally to mib.c.
	
2006-04-3 Andrew Uselton <uselton2@llnl.gov>

	* : Tag 1.9.2

	* : Take out the node averaging.  The BGL code has entirely forked
	and node averaging is only an issue there.  It is also less reasonable
	on non-BGL clusters because the tasks do not stay coordinated across 
	a node like they do on BGL.

	* : The -V option should include the architecture, not just the signon 
	message.

	* : regularize all the documentation so it all agrees.
	
2006-03-24 Andrew Uselton <uselton2@llnl.gov>

	* : Tag 1.9.1

	* : Add the architecture to the version string

2006-03-17 Andrew Uselton <uselton2@llnl.gov>

	* : Tag 1.9

	* : Allow for operation without MPI

	* : Introduce random read option

	* : Improve the mib.sh wrapper script

	* : Make the target a required argument to avoid accidentally
	writing to NFS and causing disruption

	* : Check for the file system type of the target and refuse to use
	NFS unless a "-F" (--force) flag is set.

	* : Add a version option that prints the version string and exits.

	* : Remove the "options" file code, use command line arguments only

	* : Add a unit test "mib-test.sh" to the tools directory

	* : Fix Mib_Init, it didn't return(mib) its result

	* : When there is no SLURM or MPI we set the rank and base to the 
	host's index.  That means the read test's file name needs the 
	base added to its modulo arithmatic.  When we have arbitrary 
	subcommunicators, if ever, that would also come up.

	* : "Open" for writes should have O_CREAT, and "Open" for reads
	should not.  Doing this makes the "Open" implementation straight
	forward.  

	* : If the statfs call fails, which it will if you gave it a bogus
	target directory, then you need to bail with an error message.
	I'd left out the "exit(1)".

	* : Convert to using config.h, which is created by configure, to
	detect if MPI is present on the build host, and skip using it if
	so.

	* : Set the correct include directory: /usr/lib/mpi/include in the
	Makefile.in
	
2006-03-01 Andrew Uselton <uselton2@llnl.gov>
	
	* : Tag 1.8

	* : Dump the iterateions and pause options

	* : Code factoring in the options settings

	* : Consolidate boolean flags into fields in a single flag

	* : Fixed ENOENT / ENONET bug :(

	* : Get command line options (including long-opts) working and tested

	* : Allow there to be a log_dir with no "options" file

	* : Make a man page

	* : Fix packaging

	
2006-02-15 Andrew Uselton <uselton2@llnl.gov>
	
	* : Tag 1.7
	
	* : Introduce "new" and "remove" options to allow for managing files.

	* : Introduce "use_ion_aves" option to suppress (by default) calculating
	averages accross IONs the way BGL does.

	* : Fixed the "no averages" code path so it rightly preserves
	the whole profile from a run.  

	* : Promoted the res->transferred field to a double because as a
	32 bit quantity it could overflow for really fast or long 
	accumulations of transfers.
	
2006-01-15 Andrew Uselton <uselton2@llnl.gov>
	
	* : Tag 1.6
	
	* : Introduce "profiles" option, and don't do profiles unless it is
	set

	* : Adjust defaults for operation without parameters file

	* : Reduce verbosity for default operation, summary line only

	* : Clean up "lint" detected by icc compiler, missing "returns"
	pointer arithmetic, missing "include" files <stdlib> and <string>

	* : init_timer() now uses MPI_COMM_WORLD and occurs outside the 
	iteration loop.  It also announces the program name and start 
	time.

	* : the fsync() seems to return errors that (probably) occurred
	earlier and were corrected.  Work around, investigate, fix.
	
2005-12-07 Andrew Uselton <uselton2@llnl.gov>

	* : Tag 1.5
	
	* : Discovered where the rogue ASSERT was, though not why.

	* : Retrenched to only using FAIL and ASSERT and removed 
	problematic error handling code

	* : Documented, but did not implement, details of system
	call return codes

	* : Timer intialization check

2005-12-01 Andrew Uselton <uselton2@llnl.gov>

	* : Tag 1.4
	
	* : Bool enumeration

	* : Optional read_only and write_only

	* : Progress meter
