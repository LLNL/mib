	* Tag 1.9.2

	* Take out the node averaging.  The BGL code has entirely forked
	and node averaging is only an issue there.  It is also less reasonable
	on non-BGL clusters because the tasks do not stay coordinated across 
	a node like they do on BGL.

	* The -V option should include the architecture, not just the signon 
	message.

	* regularize all the documentation so it all agrees.

	* Tag 1.9.1

	* Add the architecture to the version string

	* Tag 1.9

	* Allow for operation without MPI

	* Introduce random read option

	* Improve the mib.sh wrapper script

	* Make the target a required argument to avoid accidentally
	writing to NFS and causing disruption

	* Check for the file system type of the target and refuse to use
	NFS unless a "-F" (--force) flag is set.

	* Add a version option that prints the version string and exits.

	* Remove the "options" file code, use command line arguments only

	* Add a unit test "mib-test.sh" to the tools directory

	* Fix Mib_Init, it didn't return(mib) its result

	* When there is no SLURM or MPI we set the rank and base to the 
	host's index.  That means the read test's file name needs the 
	base added to its modulo arithmatic.  When we have arbitrary 
	subcommunicators, if ever, that would also come up.

	* "Open" for writes should have O_CREAT, and "Open" for reads
	should not.  Doing this makes the "Open" implementation straight
	forward.  

	* If the statfs call fails, which it will if you gave it a bogus
	target directory, then you need to bail with an error message.
	I'd left out the "exit(1)".

	* Convert to using config.h, which is created by configure, to
	detect if MPI is present on the build host, and skip using it if
	so.

	* Set the correct include directory: /usr/lib/mpi/include in the
	Makefile.in

	* Tag 1.8

	* Dump the iterateions and pause options

	* Code factoring in the options settings

	* Consolidate boolean flags into fields in a single flag

	* Fixed ENOENT / ENONET bug :(

	* Get command line options (including long-opts) working and tested

	* Allow there to be a log_dir with no "options" file

	* Make a man page

	* Fix packaging

	* Tag 1.7
	
	* Introduce "new" and "remove" options to allow for managing files.

	* Introduce "use_ion_aves" option to suppress (by default) calculating
	averages accross IONs the way BGL does.

	* Fixed the "no averages" code path so it rightly preserves
	the whole profile from a run.  

	* Promoted the res->transferred field to a double because as a
	32 bit quantity it could overflow for really fast or long 
	accumulations of transfers.

	* Tag 1.6
	
	* Introduce "profiles" option, and don't do profiles unless it is
	set

	* Adjust defaults for operation without parameters file

	* Reduce verbosity for default operation, summary line only

	* Clean up "lint" detected by icc compiler, missing "returns"
	pointer arithmetic, missing "include" files <stdlib> and <string>

	* init_timer() now uses MPI_COMM_WORLD and occurs outside the 
	iteration loop.  It also announces the program name and start 
	time.

	* the fsync() seems to return errors that (probably) occurred
	earlier and were corrected.  Work around, investigate, fix.

	* Tag 1.5
	
	* Discovered where the rogue ASSERT was, though not why.

	* Retrenched to only using FAIL and ASSERT and removed 
	problematic error handling code

	* Documented, but did not implement, details of system
	call return codes

	* Timer intialization check
