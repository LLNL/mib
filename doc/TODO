o  The error reporting needs to be much more refined.
  -  Look for places where ASSERT should be used
  -  The __FILE__ and __LINE__ macros already give
     enough info to document which MPI_wrapper failed
  -  System calls should be handled differently from library calls
     and the errors returned should each be handled sensibly.  This may
     end up being quite machine dependent
  -  The idea of some errors being reported out of the base task, as
     mib errors rather than system errors, is a good one, but needs to
     be handled carefully and with attention to detail
  -  The error reporting needs to be aware of both dychotomies:
     *  Exit immediately with an MPI_Abort or hold off and report back
        to base task
     *  Let __FILE__, __LINE__, and errno document the error or make up
        a mib_specific error condition

o  Test against arbitrary subcommunicators of MPI_COMM_WORLD

o  Respond to Signals

o Very small xfer sizes may want very large numbers of xfers.  See
  what is involved in allowing for that.  Perhaps I should gather and
  reduce the data before sending it to the profile files.  

o Random seeks in writes as well

o Collectively check version number and bail if there is disagreement.

o Output should report if the test was stonewalling, non-stonewalling,
  or inbetween.
