This is just a local note to myself about keeping the documentation up
to date.  

When I make a change to the functionality of mib I need to have that
change propogate through the following:
o whereever in the code the option has an effect
o opt_string in options.c
o long_opts struct in options.c
o command line options parsing loop in options.c
o usage function in options.c
o in-code comments
o commentary in README
o testing in tools/mib-test.sh
o man page mib.1
o writeup in doc/mib.tex
 
Insure that the copyright and disclaimer documentation is up to date
and present as required for review and release.
